### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of favorite labs we did as it was the first lab to start everything I know now about coding. The first time I saw that code is VSCode I was intimidated as I did not know what to do, I was a newbie. With the help of my lab partner and the TA's I was able to overcome that first hurdle and learn what it means now, I am no better than I was back then but I know more than the average person.

* Lab 3 

    Lab 3 is when it started to get more intense as now we learned a new value known as a double in our code, which was used in the Pizza.cc file. This was not hard to understand once I knew what it was but part 2 is when it got crazy. The datediff.cc was challenging as it consisted of multiple little problems to make the answer we wasnted, despite all that my lab partener and I overcame that hurdle.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was one of the first times we used images to write our code, to know what place was suitable for parking. The parking.cc was one that made my lab partner and I have to think hard about to solve this, especially with all the locations and times we had to memorize. In the end the lab was done I learned alot about images in coding and else if loops.
